## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Native build hook (`hook/build.dart`) that compiles and bundles the C shim as a code asset; `@Native` FFI bindings.
- `rewind_set_buffer_seconds` shim call for per-game replay-buffer length.
- Per-game configuration (`GameConfig`/`AppSettings`): configurable buffer length (30s/60s/custom), enabled events, and hotkey — per game.
- Game auto-detection: `GameRegistry` publishes active-game transitions; coordinator applies the active game's config automatically.
- `docs/COMPLIANCE.md`: legal / anti-cheat policy (sanctioned sources only; manual-hotkey fallback).
- Initial repository scaffold: docs (README, CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, CONTRIBUTING), GPLv3 license.
- Flutter app skeleton with entry point and app shell.
- `GameEvent` model and `GameEventSource` abstraction for extensible game integrations.
- `LeagueEventWatcher` stub (League Live Client Data API @ 127.0.0.1:2999).
- `GameRegistry` for registering/auto-selecting game integrations.
- `Clip` model, `ClipLibrary`, and `StorageManager` (storage-aware retention with pin/protect).
- `ClipCoordinator` wiring events + hotkey to the capture engine.
- C shim (`native/shim/rewind_obs.h/.c`) over libobs with Dart FFI bindings stub.
- CI and tag-driven release GitHub Actions workflows.
